          Sometime in the early 1970s, four associates started a project to build,
          what was at the time, the first condominium townhouse development in the
          Baltimore area.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph-text">
          The four developers were:
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph-text">
          <ul>
            <li class = "paragraph-text">Ferd Onnen, Towson Ford</li>
            <li class = "paragraph-text">Edwin S.Howe, Jr., Howe Insurance</li>

        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph-text">
          Built on the site of an apple orchard, part of the Howe property, they envisioned
          classic brick and stucco townhomes in the style still seen today in Georgetown.
          These were to be a new concept in townhomes offering up-scale amenities, including
          pool and tennis on-site, private roads, classic plantings, and sturdy construction. The
          interiors would include large double-hung windows, 8,9 and 10 foot ceilings, hardwood
          floors, solid wood panel doors, and classic moldings in main living areas. The floor
          plan was open with offset floors and no bearing walls, offering little impediment to
          future changes. Consistent demand for the Thornton Wood homes over the years is testament
          to the success of this enduring design concept.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph-text">
          The marketing of the property was placed with realtors Piper &amp; Company. Mary
          Lou Hearn, Sally Staples, and Fayne Farrar were co-agents; Mary Lou and Sally
          also became long-time residents.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph-text">
          The first model home was opened in 1974, before construction was completed.
          The model was open seven days a week, but as Thornton Wood was a new
          concept in living, it took time for the idea to catch-on. The initial offering price in
          1974 was $72,500, and the price in 1976 when sales were closed was still under
          $100,000. Contrast that to the asking prices today at Thornton Wood, and it is
          clear that these homes have achieved an above-average rate-of-return.

          Today, Thornton Wood reflects a mature community with well-maintained assets
          and steadily rising property values in a part of Baltimore County that is
          exceedingly convenient to Towson, the I-83 and I-695 expressways, and
          downtown Baltimore. Yet, we are also within minutes of numerous parks, golf
          courses, clubs, woodlands, and horse country. Our wooded buffer around our 11
          acres provides a level of seclusion difficult to find in today’s crowded urban
          environments. The best part of Thornton Wood living, however, is the spirit of
          community found among its residents -- our camaraderie and neighborliness --
          that makes living here a joy. Evidence of that spirit is the length of residence of
          many of our unit owners, several of whom are original purchasers.

          A condominium regime is established in Maryland under the Real Property
          Article, Title 11 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (the Condominium Act) with
          the filing of a Declaration, Condominium Plat., and By-Laws (the Condominium
          documents). The Declaration and By-Laws are included in the Condominium
          Sale Packet of information provided to all purchasers of a Thornton Wood
          townhome. All of the documents are recorded in the land records of Baltimore
          County and are available to the public.

          The Thornton Wood Condominium Association was formed as an unincorporated
          Association and is composed of the Council of Unit Owners that is all the owners
          of units in the Condominium. The Association is governed under the
          Condominium By-Laws by a Board of Directors (the Board,) duly elected by the
          owners at an annual meeting. The Board is responsible for the operation of the
          Condominium including, among other things: determination of dues, securing
          insurance, maintenance of Common Elements, and setting of rules and
          regulations.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph-text">
          Until fiscal year 2006, the Condominium was managed directly by the Board
          consisting of volunteer directors elected from the Council of Unit Owners. In
          2006, the operation of the Condominium was delegated to a professional
          property manager. A Board of elected directors continues to oversee the
          operation of the Condominium and retains all authority for policy and other
          matters.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph-text" style = "padding-bottom: 5% !important;">
          The Board meets, generally, monthly and meetings are open to all unit owners.
          Minutes of meetings are also available to all unit owners as are all condominium
          records subject to the provisions in the Condominium Documents. A meeting of
          the Council of Unit Owners is held annually, usually scheduled in March.
          Thornton Wood’s fiscal year begins April 1 and concludes the following March
          31th. Unit owners are encouraged to participate in the management of the
          condominium as elected directors or as volunteers in the various committees that
          help to maintain the community.
