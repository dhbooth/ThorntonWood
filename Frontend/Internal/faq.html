              Exterior paint colors are governed by Section 12 of the Rules and

              approval before beginning to paint. Please contact the Buildings and
              Roads Chair with any questions and for access to the paint charts;
              alternatively, a digital version of the paint charts is available in the Forms tab.

            <p>
              For a lost key, locksmiths will not make extra keys unless you have an
              original key with the number on it.  Without a key, a new lock must be
              ordered. It&#39;s a good idea to make a record of your mailbox key code (5
              digit number on the key.)
            </p>
            <p>
              For a new lock, you can order from the website: www.mailboxes.com/ OR
              call 800-MAILBOX (624-5269). Our mailboxs are the 2200 series. The
              part number for the lock is 2290, and includes two keys; to order extra
              keys, note that the part number is 2298.
            </p>
              Please note that certain lock troubles may be avoided by annually
              squirting a lubricant into the lock mechanism from the outside.  Then,
              insert the key and operate the lock to distribute the lubricant.

          <div id="faq7d" class="drop-down">
            <p>
              The Association maintains a Master Insurance Policy on the Common
              Elements, Limited Common Elements, as well as the units for typical
              perils. In addition, the Board has secured insurance for water back-up
              coverage, with a limit of $ 50,000 on each of the six buildings and will
              cover damage to the buildings if (1) water or sewage should back-up
              through the sanitary waste lines due to a clog, or (2) water came up
              through the sump pit because of a power failure or inoperative pump.
              Please note that this added insurance does NOT cover ground water or
              water which might enter through the foundation. The cost of the
              aforementioned insurance coverage is a common expense which is
              included in the quarterly assessments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The individual unit coverage under the Master Policy includes the
              structure and all components as originally constructed up to and including
              the walls, ceilings, roof, original floors, and other original painting,
              appliances, fixtures, and etc..  
            </p>
            <p>
              The initial deductible on the Master Policy is $5,000 (as of 4/2013).  In
              other words, the Association is self-insured for the first $5,000 of any
              covered loss. The deductible becomes a common expense should a
              covered loss be incurred.  However, as of June 1, 2009, the Maryland
              condominium law was amended to provide that if a loss covered under
              the Association’s master policy originates within a unit, the owner will be
              responsible for the insurance deductible up to $5,000; any loss above
              that limit is covered by the Association.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unit owners are encouraged, not required, to separately obtain coverage
              for personal property within the units as well as improvements and
              betterments (including any and all improvements made to the original
              construction, e.g. upgraded cabinets, appliances, wall coverings, carpets,
              added rooms or baths, etc.).  In Maryland, this policy is referred to as a
              HO-6 standard form. Unit owners are advised to add a rider for
              replacement cost and another to cover liability for the deductible should a
              loss originate in your unit.  Please consult your insurance agent to help
              you decide how much of each coverage to have in your unit owner&#39;s
              policy.
